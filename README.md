# text_speech
simple program that takes a video (or an audio file if you want) and returns a MS word file (you can change with a normal txt file) with the transcription of the entire (or a part) video

Put the video you want to text speech in a folder named "VIDEO", create two more folders, "temp_audio" and "temp_video". Create the last folder, named "TEXT_SPEECH". You will find the MS word output file inside. Maybe the text speech will fail. If so, the failed text speech's filename will be marked

IMPORTANT: you have to name all the video files like "video (1).mp4", "video (2).mp4" etc. 
You can change this by editing the code
